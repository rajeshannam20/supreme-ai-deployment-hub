# Cost Optimization Strategy

This document outlines Devonn.AI's comprehensive strategy for AWS cost optimization while maintaining high availability and performance in production environments.

## 1. Reserved Instances Strategy

### EC2 & RDS Reserved Instances

#### Current State Analysis
- Run `aws ce get-cost-and-usage` reports to identify consistently running instances
- Look for instances with >70% uptime over 30 days

#### Commitment Planning
- **Production Environments**:
  - 1-year Standard RIs for baseline workloads (40% savings)
  - 3-year Convertible RIs for stable, long-term workloads (60% savings)
- **Non-Production Environments**:
  - Savings Plans for flexible compute usage
  - Spot Instances where possible

#### Implementation Plan
```bash
# Example for purchasing RDS Reserved Instances
aws rds purchase-reserved-db-instances-offering \
  --reserved-db-instances-offering-id [offering-id] \
  --db-instance-count 1 \
  --tags Key=Environment,Value=production Key=Project,Value=devonn-ai
```

#### Monitoring and Adjustment
- Set up monthly reviews of RI utilization
- Adjust RI portfolio based on changing workloads
- Set up alerts for underutilized RIs

## 2. Auto-Scaling Optimization

### EKS Node Auto-Scaling

#### Scaling Policies
- Use Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) for granular container scaling
- Configure Cluster Autoscaler for node scaling based on pod demand
- Use CloudWatch metrics for custom scaling triggers

```yaml
# Example HPA configuration
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: devonn-api
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: devonn-api
  minReplicas: 2
  maxReplicas: 10
  metrics:
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: cpu
      target:
        type: Utilization
        averageUtilization: 70
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: memory
      target:
        type: Utilization
        averageUtilization: 80
```

#### Schedule-Based Scaling
- Implement automated scale-down for non-production environments during off-hours
- Use AWS Auto Scaling schedules to reduce capacity during known low-usage periods

```bash
# Example scheduled scaling action
aws autoscaling put-scheduled-update-group-action \
  --auto-scaling-group-name devonn-nonprod-nodes \
  --scheduled-action-name night-scale-down \
  --recurrence "0 20 * * *" \
  --min-size 1 \
  --max-size 2 \
  --desired-capacity 1
```

#### Right-Sizing Instances
- Run resource utilization analysis every 30 days
- Adjust instance types based on actual CPU, memory, and I/O usage
- Consider Graviton-based instances for cost efficiency

## 3. Storage Optimization

### S3 Lifecycle Management

#### Data Classification
- Define data classes based on access patterns:
  - **Hot data**: Frequently accessed, Standard storage
  - **Warm data**: Occasionally accessed, Infrequent Access storage
  - **Cold data**: Rarely accessed, Glacier storage
  - **Archive data**: Compliance/backup, Glacier Deep Archive

#### Lifecycle Rules
```bash
# Example S3 lifecycle rule implementation
aws s3api put-bucket-lifecycle-configuration \
  --bucket devonn-data-production \
  --lifecycle-configuration file://lifecycle-config.json
```

#### Example lifecycle-config.json:
```json
{
  "Rules": [
    {
      "ID": "Move to IA after 30 days",
      "Status": "Enabled",
      "Prefix": "logs/",
      "Transitions": [
        {
          "Days": 30,
          "StorageClass": "STANDARD_IA"
        },
        {
          "Days": 90,
          "StorageClass": "GLACIER"
        }
      ],
      "Expiration": {
        "Days": 365
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### RDS Storage Optimization

- Enable storage autoscaling with proper maximum limits
- Schedule regular PostgreSQL vacuum operations
- Monitor storage growth patterns and adjust provisioned storage as needed
- Implement table partitioning for large tables

## 4. Resource Tagging Strategy

### Tagging Policy

#### Required Tags
- **Environment**: `production`, `staging`, `development`, `test`
- **Project**: `devonn-ai`
- **CostCenter**: `engineering`, `research`, `operations`
- **Owner**: Email address of team or individual owner
- **Application**: Specific application or service name
- **ManagedBy**: `terraform`, `manual`, `cloudformation`

#### Implementation
```bash
# Example tagging EC2 instances
aws ec2 create-tags \
  --resources i-1234567890abcdef0 \
  --tags Key=Environment,Value=production Key=CostCenter,Value=engineering

# Example tagging RDS instances
aws rds add-tags-to-resource \
  --resource-name arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:db:devonn-postgres-production \
  --tags Key=Environment,Value=production Key=CostCenter,Value=engineering
```

### Cost Allocation

- Set up AWS Cost Explorer with tag-based reports
- Create monthly cost reports by:
  - Environment
  - CostCenter
  - Application
- Set up anomaly detection and budgets based on tags

```bash
# Create budget by application tag
aws budgets create-budget \
  --account-id 123456789012 \
  --budget file://app-budget.json \
  --notifications-with-subscribers file://budget-notifications.json
```

## 5. Advanced Cost Reduction Strategies

### Compute Savings Plans

- Analyze compute usage patterns using AWS Cost Explorer
- Purchase Compute Savings Plans for steady-state workloads
- Monitor and adjust Savings Plans commitment based on utilization

### Spot Instances for Non-Critical Workloads

- Identify fault-tolerant workloads suitable for Spot Instances:
  - Batch processing jobs
  - Data analysis workloads
  - Test environments
  - Stateless components of the application

```yaml
# Example Kubernetes deployment with spot instances
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: devonn-batch-processor
spec:
  replicas: 3
  template:
    spec:
      nodeSelector:
        lifecycle: spot
      containers:
      - name: batch-processor
        image: devonn/batch-processor:latest
        resources:
          requests:
            memory: "1Gi"
            cpu: "500m"
          limits:
            memory: "2Gi"
            cpu: "1000m"
```

### Resource Scheduling

- Implement automated start/stop schedules for development and test environments
- Use AWS Instance Scheduler or custom Lambda functions
- Track idle resources and shut them down automatically

### Data Transfer Optimization

- Place services in the same region to minimize cross-region data transfer costs
- Use AWS PrivateLink for private service-to-service communication
- Implement caching strategies to reduce redundant data transfers
- Compress data before transfer when appropriate

## 6. Monitoring and Optimization Tools

### AWS Cost Management Tools

- **AWS Cost Explorer**: Visualize and analyze costs and usage
- **AWS Budgets**: Set custom budgets and receive alerts
- **AWS Trusted Advisor**: Identify optimization opportunities
- **AWS Compute Optimizer**: Get instance type recommendations

### Custom Monitoring

- Create CloudWatch dashboards for cost KPIs
- Set up alerts for unusual spending patterns
- Schedule weekly cost review meetings

```bash
# Example CloudWatch alarm for monthly spend
aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm \
  --alarm-name "Monthly spend exceeding budget" \
  --alarm-description "Alarm when monthly spend exceeds budget" \
  --metric-name "EstimatedCharges" \
  --namespace "AWS/Billing" \
  --statistic Maximum \
  --period 86400 \
  --threshold 1000 \
  --comparison-operator GreaterThanThreshold \
  --dimensions Name=Currency,Value=USD \
  --evaluation-periods 1 \
  --alarm-actions arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:billing-alarm
```
